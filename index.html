The Vessel will not navigate beyond the navigational limits set forth in the Vessel’s insurance policy without prior written approval by the OWNER and the Vessel’s insurer, with any additional insurance premiums agreed to be paid by the CHARTERER. Operation of the Vessel beyond the approved area or in violation of law constitutes a breach of this Agreement and cause for immediate termination of this Agreement without refund of the Charter Fee.

The Vessel will comply with all laws, rules, and regulations of government agencies of the United States, individual states, and any other jurisdictions where the Vessel travel, including any federal and state marine parks, sanctuaries, and protected areas.

The OWNER shall maintain insurance throughout the Charter Period against any liability for personal injury or death of the captain or crew, including, without limitation, any liability under the Jones Act or the general maritime law of the United States. The OWNER shall indemnify and hold the CHARTERER and the CHARTERER’s guests harmless against and from any liability for any loss, damage, or expense arising from or in connection with any personal injury or death of the captain or any member of the crew unless caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the CHARTERER or the CHARTERER’s guests or invitees.

						However, the captain will not be bound to comply with any order or request by the CHARTERER which, in the reasonable opinion of the captain, might result in (i) the Vessel’s moving to any port or place that is not safe and proper for it to be in; (ii) the CHARTERER’s failing to Re-Deliver the Vessel upon the expiration of the Charter Period; or (iii) the breach of Clause 13 or any other clause of this Agreement. If the CHARTERER or any of the CHARTERER’s guests or invitees fails to observe any of the provisions of Clause 13 below, and such failure continues after the captain gives written notice to the CHARTERER thereof, then the captain will immediately inform the OWNER, the Broker, and the Escrow Agent of such breach. Upon receiving such notice, in addition to any other remedies the OWNER may have, the OWNER may terminate the Charter immediately and instruct the captain to return the Vessel to the Port of Re-Delivery. In that case, the CHARTERER and his guests shall immediately disembark the Vessel; this Agreement and the Charter Period will be terminated upon the Vessel’s return to the Port of Re-Delivery; and the CHARTERER shall settle all outstanding expenses with the captain beforehand and the CHARTERER will not be entitled to any refund of the Charter Fee.
